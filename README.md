# Hackathon Blockchain Submission
Louie Doswell and Joshua Stewart Futcher

Using Hardhat as a development environment, we have created a decentralised token auctioning system.

The frontend was built using React and communicates with the smart contract using ethers.js.

The backend is written in Solidity and is deployed on a test network called Sepolia, meaning it has zero cost to run.
It also currently does not have functionality for taking any real payments, but instead some functionality for a fake balance stored on the smart contract itself.
Maybe the frontend could have some method for a user to add to the balance or deal with transfering eth directly from auction buyer to auction seller.


Unfortunately, we did not have time to link the backend to the front-end.
